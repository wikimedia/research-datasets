# research repository

This repository serves multiple purposes
- library for sharing and reusing code for research at wmf. E.g. pipeline transformations for
    - graphs revision graph, diffs 
    - redirect resolution, link graph between articles
    - topic modelling
    - ...
- datasets. Pipelines that create datasets as output
- tooling for running orchestrated machine learning pipelines in the data engineering infrastructure
    - running airflow dags
    - gpu training on yarn cluster
    - custom workloads using skein 


Instead of splitting different functionality into different repos prematurely, this will be a mono repo for now.
