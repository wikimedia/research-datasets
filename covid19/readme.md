# Covid Dataset

This data release includes two Wikipedia datasets related to the readership of the project as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic period. The first dataset is COVID-19 article page views by country, the second dataset is one hop navigation where one of the two pages are COVID-19 related. The data covers roughly the first six months of the pandemic, more specifically from January 1st 2020 to June 30th 2020. 

Wikipedia articles are considered COVID-19 related according the methodology described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2020-04-26/By_the_numbers), the list of COVID-19 articles used for the released datasets is available in `covid_articles.tsv`.

## Privacy considerations

The Wikimedia foundation started to release [most viewed articles](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Pageviews#Most_viewed_articles_per_country) by country from Jan 2021. At the beginning of the COVID-19 an exemption was made to store reader data about the pandemic with additional privacy protections:
- the page views from users engaged in an edit session are ignored
- reader data from [specific countries](https://github.com/wikimedia/analytics-refinery/blob/master/static_data/mediawiki/geoeditors/blacklist/country_codes.tsv) is ignored
- the aggregated statistics are based on 50% of reader sessions that involve a pageview to a COVID-19-related article (see list). As a control, a 1% random sample of reader sessions that have no pageviews to COVID-19-related articles was kept. In aggregate, we make sure this 1% non-COVID-19 sample and 50% COVID-19 sample represents less than 10% of pageviews for a country for that day.
- exclude power users - i.e. userhashes with greater than X pageviews in a day. This doubles as another form of likely bot removal, protects very heavy users of the project, and also in theory would help reduce the chance of a single user heavily skewing the data.
 
In effect, the view counts in this dataset release represent comparable trends rather than the total amount of traffic from a given country. For more background on readership data per country data, and the COVID-19 privacy protections in particular, see this [phabricator](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T207171#6547759).

A k-anonymity threshold of 100 was applied to the aggregated counts. For example, a page needs to be viewed at least 100 times in a given country and week in order to be included in the dataset. In addition, the view counts are floored to a multiple of 100.

## Datasets

The datasets published in this release are derived from a reader session dataset generated by the code in this [notebook]( https://github.com/geohci/covid-19-sessions/blob/master/covid_19_data.ipynb). The reader session data itself will not be publically available due to privacy considerations. The datasets described below are similar to the [pageviews](https://pageviews.toolforge.org/?project=en.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&redirects=0&range=latest-20&pages=COVID-19_pandemic) and [clickstream](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_clickstream) data that the Wikimedia foundation publishes already, with the addition of the country specific counts. 

### COVID-19 pageviews

The file `covid_pageviews.tsv` contains
- pageview counts for COVID-19 related pages, aggregated by week and country
- k-anonymity threshold of 100
- example: In the 13th week of 2020, the page 'PandÃ©mie_de_covid-19' on French wikipedia was visited a 1008 times from readers in Belgium
- as a control bucket, we include pageview counts to all pages aggregated by week and country. Due to privacy considerations during the collection of the data, the control bucket was sampled at ~1% of all view traffic. The view counts for the `control` title are thus proportional to the total number of pageviews to all pages.

### One-hop reader data

The file `covid_one_hop.tsv` contains
- number of occurences of visits to pages A -> B, where either A or B is a COVID-19 related article
- aggregated by month and country
- k-anomity threshold of 100
- example: In March of 2020, there were a 147 occurences of readers accessing the page `es.wikipedia/Coronavirus` followed by `es.wikipedia/Virus` from Argentina
